                        <p><strong>I grew up in rural Putney, Vermont, with my parents, older sister,
                            and cat.</strong> I did a lot of drawing and cross-country skiing.
                        I went to highschool as a day student at Northfield Mount Hermon in Western Massachusetts.
                        I took a gap year before college, during which I went on some great adventures in Chile, Bolivia,
                        Cuba, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Denmark, and Crested Butte, Colorado.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><strong>I am currently an (undeclared) CS and Physics major at Middlebury College in Vermont, and will probably pick up a minor in Math.</strong>
                        I am attracted to problems at the intersection of quantitative, aesthetic, and philosophical thought.
                        I aspire to live an impactful and creative life, and think that we live in an era of profound importance.
                        I enjoy learning and challenges, and thus hope for a lifestyle which requires frequent adaptation.
                        Both intellectually and practically, I am most excited about information networks' relationship
                        with human social structure.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><strong>I believe that curiousity is fundamentally good, that the natural world is sacred, and that individuals' decisions impact the
                        quality of the future.</strong></p>

                    <!--    while avoiding sinister blue and white cars and acquiring mysterious power-up mushrooms.-->

                    <!--    Despite my enjoyment of the elective, I did not code again until my senior year, when I took my highschool's-->
