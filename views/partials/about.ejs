                    <div id="bio-text" class="about-text">
                        <p>I grew up in rural Putney, Vermont, with my parents, older sister, and cat. I did a lot of playing, drawing, and cross-country skiing.
                        I went to highschool as a day student at Northfield Mount Hermon in Western Massachusetts,
                        where I continued to spend a lot of time playing. I was the captain of the cross-country ski team, and competed in varsity crew, track, and
                        lacrosse.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Currently, I'm taking a gap year before attending college. Some of my more exciting adventures have been two week-long Cuba peregrinations, a few weeks
                        of living in my car and working as a landscaper in Nantucket,
                        a 70ish day journey through Chile and Bolivia, where I spent something like half my time working at two hostels (one in Pucon and another in Santiago), and 
                        the long process of learning to build websites. At the moment, I'm working as a lift operator at Crested Butte Mountain Resort in Colorado, where I've learned that I love
                        freestyle skiing as much as I love backcountry skiing.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>Some of my more defining characteristics are my intensity, independence, intellectual curiousity, ambition,
                        intolerance of bullshit and hypocrisy, creativity, adventurousness, sociability, impatience, obsessiveness, and hubris.</p> 
                        <br/>
                        <p>While I am still very much a student, my primary professional skills are web development/design and analytical/persuasive writing.
                        In the future, I hope to apply information technology solutions to problems surrounding environmental conservation and the health of our civilization.</p>

                    <div id="values-text" class="about-text">
                        <h5>I believe that curiousity is fundamentally good, that the natural world is sacred, and that individuals' decisions 
                        impact the quality of the future.</h5> 
                        <br/>
                        <p>I believe that people should only work towards goals which align with their values, and that the only reason to collaborate
                        is to work towards common goals. Therefore, shared values should be the foundation of any working relationship. It is a flaw of our
                        tech-era collaborative tools (and indeed capitalist collaboration in general) that everybody shares what they can do, but not why 
                        they want to do those things. I will address this problem here.</p>
                        <br/>
                        <p><b>I care about conserving the natural beauty of our world,</b> which I believe to be an elementary ingredient of human health and joy.
                        <br><br><b>I believe that intellectual curiousity is the noblest human craving,</b> and a natural consequence of the decision to appreciate life.
                        Extending this, I think that education is the single most important social system.
                        <br><br><b>I consider liberty to be an intrinsically valuable end in itself,</b> and that we as a global community are at greater risk of losing our sense 
                        of liberty than we have collectively been since the rise of fascism in the 20th century â€“ this by virtue of complacency and panic more than hatred and demagoguery.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ultimately, for me, while solipsism is logically inevitable, it is fruitful to pursue an intangible sense of universal harmony based on well thought-out moral assumptions, 
                        like the protection and continuation of the human historical narrative.</p>
